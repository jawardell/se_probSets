# Refac 

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor a method in the TestEngine.java 
class. The method exhibited the long method bad-smell. Moreover, the method is 
a bloater type of bad smell which means that the method has accumulated too much 
code over time. Bloaters can be addressed by identifying groups of code that could 
be removed from the large method and placed into a new sub-method, variable, or 
logical expression.
